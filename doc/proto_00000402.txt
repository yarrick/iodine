Detailed specification of protocol in version 00000402
======================================================

CMC = 2 byte Cache Miss Counter, increased every time it is used

Version:
Client sends:
        First byte v or V
        Rest encoded with base32:
        4 bytes big endian protocol version
        CMC
Server replies:
        4 chars:
                VACK (version ok), followed by login challenge
                VNAK (version differs), followed by server protocol version
                VFUL (server has no free slots), followed by max users
        4 byte value: means login challenge/server protocol version/max users
        1 byte userid of the new user, or any byte if not VACK

Login:
Client sends:
        First byte l or L
        Rest encoded with base32:
        1 byte userid
        16 bytes MD5 hash of: (first 32 bytes of password) xor (8 repetitions of login challenge)
        CMC
Server replies:
        LNAK means not accepted
        x.x.x.x-y.y.y.y-mtu means accepted (server ip, client ip, mtu)

Case check:
Client sends:
        First byte z or Z
        Lots of data that should not be decoded
Server replies:
        The requested domain copied raw

Data:
Data header:
         321 0
        +---+-+
        |UUU|L|
        +---+-+

UUU = Userid
L = Last fragment in packet flag

First byte is the header, 4 bits coded as hex in ASCII.
Followed by data encoded with Base32.

Ping:
Client sends:
        First byte p or P
        Rest encoded with Base32:
        1 byte userid
        CMC

The server response to Ping and Data packets is a DNS NULL type response:
If server has nothing to send, data length is 0 bytes.
If server has a packet to send, data length is set and the data is a full raw
unencoded ip packet, prefixed with 32 bits tun data.
