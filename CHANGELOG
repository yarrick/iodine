		does not include localhost.
	- The client will now exit if configuring IP or MTU fails.
	- The starting cache miss value is randomized at startup, fixes #65.
	- Raw UDP mode added. If the iodined server is reachable directly,
		packets can be sent to it without DNS encoding. Fixes #36.
	- Do not overwrite users CC/CFLAGS/LDFLAGS, only add to them.
	- Added -F option to write pidfile, based on patch from
		misc at mandriva.org. Fixes #70.

2009-06-01: 0.5.2 "WifiFree"
	- Fixed client segfault on OS X, #57
	- Added check that nameserver lookup was successful
	- Fixed ENOTSOCK error on OS X and FreeBSD, #58.

2009-03-21: 0.5.1 "Boringo"
	- Added initial Windows support, fixes #43.
	- Added length check of autoprobe responses
	- Refactored and added unit tests
	- Added syslog logging for iodined on version and login packets
	- Fixed segfault when encoding just one block, fixes #51.
		The normal code was never affected by this.
	- Added win32 code to read DNS server from system, fixes #45.
	- Disabled password echo on win32, fixes #44.
	- Fix encoding error making all autoprobing > 1024 bytes fail, #52.
	- Increase default interface MTU to 1200.
	- Fix autoprobing error making every third probe fail, set IP flag
		Dont-Fragment where supported. Fixes #54.
	- Added TAP32 version 0901 as accepted (#53).

2009-01-23: 0.5.0 "iPassed"
	- Fixed segfault in server when sending version reject.
	- Applied patch to make iodine build on BeOS R5-BONE and Haiku,
		from Francois Revol. Still work to do to get tun device working.
	- Added capability to forward DNS queries outside tunnel domain to
		a nameserver on localhost. Use -b port to enable, fixes #31.
	- iodined now replies to NS request on its own domain, fixes issue #33.
		The destination IP address is sent as reply. Use -n to specify
		a specific IP address to return (if behind NAT etc).
	- Upstream data is now Base64 encoded if relay server preserves case and
		supports the plus (+) character in domain names, fixes #16.
	- Fixed problem in client when DNS trans. ID has highest bit set (#37)
	- IP addresses are now assigned within the netmask, so iodined can
		use any address for itself, fixes #28.
	- Netmask size is now adjustable. Setting a small net will reduce the
		number of users. Use x.x.x.x/n notation on iodined tunnel ip.
		This fixes #27.
	- Downstream data is now fragmented, and the fragment size is auto-
		probed after login. Fixes #7. It only took a few years :)
	- Enhanced the checks that validates incoming packets
	- Fixed endless loop in fragment size autodetection, #39.
	- Fixed broken hostname dot placing with specific lengths, #40.

2008-08-06: 0.4.2 "Opened Zone"
	- Applied a few small patches from Maxim Bourmistrov and Gregor Herrmann
	- Applied a patch for not creating and configuring the tun interface,
		Debian bug #477692 by Vincent Bernat, controlled by -s switch
	- Applied a security patch from Andrew Griffiths, use setgroups() to
		limit the groups of the user
	- Applied a patch to make iodine build on (Open)Solaris, from Albert Lee
		Needs TUN/TAP driver http://www.whiteboard.ne.jp/~admin2/tuntap/
		Still needs more code in tun.c for opening/closing the device
	- Added option in server (-c) to disable IP/port checking on packets,
		will hopefully help when server is behind NAT
	- Fixed bug #21, now only IP address part of each packet is checked.
		Should remove the need for the -c option and also work with
		bugfixed DNS servers worldwide.
	- Added -D option on server to enable debugging. Debug level 1 now 
		prints info about each RX/TX datagram.

2007-11-30: 0.4.1 "Tea Online"

	- Top domain limited to 128 chars
	- Case preservation check sent after login to decide codec
	- Fixed crash on incoming NULL query in server with bad top domain
	- /etc/resolv.conf is consulted if no nameserver is given on commandline
